# Spaces2Graphs

A three storied building represented as a visual graph using D3. The space information of all the rooms were gathered using DynamoBIM from the revit model of the building. Each room is represented as a 'bubble' and the different levels are represented by different colors. The size of the bubble is directly proportional to the area of the space it represents. A simple proof of concept to show the adjacency of spaces in a complex building. The link to view it https://mighty-crag-51954.herokuapp.com/
